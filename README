== iWFMS

A Intelligent workflow management system. Specially looking at model the workflow of a hospital and drug distribution process.

This is a copy of the code I wrote for my masters thesis. It was written in Prolog and PHP. 

This is more for reference than a working system. Its nearly 4 years since I ran this so I cannot guarantee it will work straight out of the box.

== Dependencies

Has only ever been tested on a windows XP machine.

* Sicstus Prolog
* Berkley DB
* PHP
* Apache
