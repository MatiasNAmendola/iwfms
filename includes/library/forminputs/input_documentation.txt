The system is based around the seperation of

Generic level of abstraction (lowest)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Logic- 
		PHP and fetching data from the database.

2. Display 
		Processing the array passed ready for output. Any essential HTML.

3. Style
		HTML, Input elements, anything that is specific to a style.


Higher level of abstraction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Specific form structures		

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		
Specific form structures like 'show onsite' or 'pagetype' are constructed in the format -
{
	fetch data   //logic
	display data //display and style
}
	
Specific structures take the building blocks of the generic form elements and contruct more complex structures.
This could be anything the programmer wants, but it should avoid having code that breaches the lower levels of abstration.

Rather create the new building blocks using Logic, Display and style seperation and then uses them in this more complex 
specific function. This is not always possible but MUST be upheld whenever possible. 

Example- Image form structure - INCORRECT!
{
	Image_element
}

It would be wrong to define one function that did both these elements. Always break apart until it is 
no longer possible

Example- Image form structure - CORRECT!
{
	Image_button    
	image_picture
}


The Logic, Display and Style must be provided for the lowest level of abstraction.
